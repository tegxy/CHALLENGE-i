# CHALLENGE-i
**My first git repo**
This is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**#The challenge :** Mainly the ability to use hover states for interactive elements**

**Process**

Built with

- VScode
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

**What I learned**
Being that I'm still learning frontend development, I was able work on a few things for the first time and understand them properly.
Some of the CSS properties were:
- how to use my floats properly (always remember to clear floats)
<style>
  .clear-float {
                  clear: both;}
  </style>
  <body>
  ......
 <div class="clear-float"></div>
  </body>
 
- how and when to using positioning
- more knowledge on divs, their height and width

There are still other things i need to learn and I'll still need to keep practicing.
